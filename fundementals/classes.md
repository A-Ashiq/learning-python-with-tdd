# Classes

Okay so now things get really interesting.&#x20;

If you've heard of the phrase Object-Orientated Programming (OOP), then by the end of this chapter you will understand why we can now consider classes to be the centre of OOP in Python.&#x20;

Imagine you are an architect, the kind that designs buildings. In order for your work to result in a building you have to come up with a design for that building. Those design deliverables would be a pack of drawings (blueprints in US money) and specifications. These documents describe what the building should look like, where all the doors and windows and walls should be located. The builder takes all of this information and constructs the building according to that information. Classes represent the design and a kind of blueprint. The objects which we create by insantiating those classes represent the buildings themselves, the end product so to speak.

{% hint style="info" %}
Classes act as a specification, here we define how our objects should behave and what they should do. We can instantiate (create) as many objects from our class as we want to.
{% endhint %}

If this doesn't make sense yet. Don't worry, as always we'll guide our learning with tests to get a practical sense of what is going on.
