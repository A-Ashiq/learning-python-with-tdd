# Sets

A set in Python is an unordered array-like data structure. The most interesting and useful thing to note about sets is that they de-duplicate items and therefore only contain unique items. Under certain scenarios this can be a very useful property if we don't need to care about ordering.

Let's create ourselves a test file so that we can prove some of these concepts to ourselves.

```
touch test_sets.py
```
