# Parallelism

Parallelism is more likely to be what we might think of when we talk about concurrent programming. Whereas [concurrency](concurrency.md) does not actually lead to N number of tasks being executed at the same time, parallelism does mean that in the truest form.

So you're probably thinking, well if concurrency means our program only executes instructions from 1 task at any 1 given time then why would we ever use it? Why not just always use parallelism?
