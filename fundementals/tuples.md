# Tuples

The next data structure we will cover is the tuple.

Tuples are a similar sequence data type to lists. However, tuples are an immutable, built-in data structure of a fixed capacity. This means that once we create them, we cannot then modify them in-place like we saw with lists in the last section.

Tuples are denoted by comma seperated items. These are often wrapped with round brackets, `()`. But it is the `,` characters not the round brackets which instantiate tuples for us.

To prove some of the core characteristics of tuples, we can create a new test file. In your terminal:

```
touch test_tuples.py
```
