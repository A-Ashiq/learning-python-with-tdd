# Dictionaries

A dictionary is akin to a hash map or associative arrays in other languages. Don't worry just yet if you don't know what any of that means either!

The data structures that we've covered so far, lists, tuples and sets can be said to be _sequence-based_ data structures. Dictionaries are the outlier, as they are indexed by keys, each of which map to a corresponding value.

It is best to think of dictionaries as a set of key-value pairs. Whereby the uniqueness of sets applies and as such the keys within a dictionary are unique.

The keys of dictionaries are hashed. This allows for drastically faster lookup of keys in a dictionary compared to equivalent lookups in sequence-based data structures like lists.
