# Code styling

Okay so I can be pretty lazy sometimes.

I also don't like spending valuable time debating coding styles. I'm not talking about functionality here, I'm really talking about styles. Whether to use break lines in certain places or add a comma here or there.

And we're all different. As humans we also all prefer slightly different styles. So without an agreed baseline of coding styles, we could otherwise fall into the trap of wasting time discussing styles.

Fortunately there are some pretty good tools out there which solve these problems. When it comes to addressing code styles, these can generally be broken down into 2 main subgroups:

* **Linters** can analyse our code for smells and patterns which are deemed low quality and highlight them to us.
* **Formatters** will take our code and re-write them to conform to an adjustable set of rules. They tidy up our code to an opinionated set of guidelines whilst maintaining the logic and functionality.
