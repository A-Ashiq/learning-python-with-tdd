# Introduction

Now that we've got a framework laid out for ourselves, we can move step forward into our first project together.

We are going to start off with a set of requirememts. We are going to build towards the solution and then we'll adapt to a new set of requirements. The idea is to get us to building under real-world scenarios, or at least emulate changes in direction that we can often find ourselves having to adapt to when our product owners come to us with new requirements.

Our product owner wants us to build an HTTP REST API which will allow users to calculate and determine how much tax they owe.

We will build our application with modularity in mind and letting our tests drive our development.
