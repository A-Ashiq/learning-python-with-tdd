# Additional functionality

Now that we've got the interfaces to our system set up and working we're in a pretty good position. We know that both the HTTP API and the CLI are both hooked up to our core domain logic.&#x20;

The great thing about this is that if we make improvements to or add additonal functionality or even fix bugs in that core domain logic, then our interface components reap the benefits.&#x20;

This is one of the big bonus points that we get for free when we design our systems with the correct abstractions in place.&#x20;
