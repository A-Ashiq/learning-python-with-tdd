# Refactoring

You might have heard of the word _refactoring_ before. But now we're gonna put that into practice. Refactoring is the process **changing how a piece of code is implemented** and structured. The crucial part of this process is that the **funcionality must remain the same.**&#x20;

In other words, we can tidy up some piece of code but it must still produce the same results. If the results change then we've strayed away and further afield than just refactoring.

This is where having tests in place can really shine. We can lean on our tests and rely on them as a kind of safety harness to catch us if we stray too far with our changes.
