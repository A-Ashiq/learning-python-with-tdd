# Framework

So we've got our directory setup and the virtual environment is ready for us. You would be forgiven for thinking it is time for us to start writing code.

Our product owner wants us to build an HTTP REST API. So how do we get started? We'd have to build an HTTP server for our API. But that is going to be a lot of work before we get anywhere near writing the business logic to solve the problem statement put forward to us by the product owner. Wouldn't it be great if there was a kind of template that we could use that gave us the HTTP server for free and we could then build the things that specifically matter to us on top of that?

This is where frameworks can be a very worthwhile investment. They take away a lot of work required up front from us and allow us to spend more time building the things that matter specifically to us.&#x20;

That being said, they do come with their own learning curve. And depending on the type of framework we've chosen we might be provided with a lot more functionality than we actually need, leading to bloat throughout our codebase.

These frameworks can give us easy ways to build endpoints, provide [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi) documentation and even [Object Relational Mappings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279613/what-is-an-orm-how-does-it-work-and-how-should-i-use-one) (ORMs). If you don't know what these mean, don't worry we'll be covering them in this chapter.&#x20;
