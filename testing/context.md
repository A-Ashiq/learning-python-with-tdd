Okay so you've done your first couple of online courses and you've written a hello world app or maybe something a little more exciting.

And straight off the bat I'm going to tell you that testing is probably one of the most important things to understand and appreciate.&#x20;

I'm also going to tell you that writing test code is a skill which you will need if you want to build robust software that can stand the test of time. So I guess you could say it's pretty important

## Why write tests?

Writing robust, maintable software is a difficult thing. It's all but impossible to do without tests in place.

Tests provide us with a few things:

* They verify our assumptions of our code and tell us whether or not source code is behaving in the way we want.&#x20;
* They double up as specification. Each test can act as a clause. Whereby each test/clause describes a subset of behaviour. This is really important as this _describes how we intend our software to operate._
* After rectifying a bug, we can write tests to catch the bug. By doing this we can add to our _specification._ In doing this, we can always ensure from that point onwards that our software does not exhibit the faulty behaviour which lead to the bug in the first place.&#x20;
