# Test Driven Development

## Introduction

Traditionally, one would write their software first and after this they would write the tests to support their source code. Test Driven Development (TDD) flips this on its head.

In a nutshell, TDD is the approach of writing tests before writing your source code and using the tests to guide you throughout the development process.&#x20;

Kent Beck is often credited with bringing TDD to the forefront in the early 2000s. And TDD is a core component of the [Extreme Programming (XP)](https://agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/) movement. But for now we'll get into some more detail around TDD.
