# Introduction

This course is an end-to-end step-by-step guide on building an applications in Python. In this course I will talk through a broad range of concepts, particularly around the why including the how.

## Context

I have been working as a software engineer for a number of years now. With my last couple of years spent leading teams. During this time I've tried a few things for both myself and the people around me.

### Why am I building this course?

This is pretty simple. My goal here is to build the course that I wish was available when I was starting out.&#x20;

There is a whole world of learning material out there. Like anything in life. Some good, some not so good. Looking back on it, lots of the material I used felt piecemeal. With lots of good approaches scattered around. I had to try and piece these together for myself over time.

This relates in particular to testing. Which in my opinion should be front and centre when it comes to learning a new language.

### How I struggle learning new languages

The trickiest thing I have found, particularly earlier in my career was that I could not find learning material which taught me how to build useful applications that meant something **real**.&#x20;

I could sit and do HackerRank challenges for days on end, and it wouldn't really sink in. I tried other sources to varying degrees of success including YouTube videos, books, paid for online Udemy-type courses.

A lot of the time, I'd learn syntax or the rough outline of concepts but I was missing a key piece. How does one go about building robust software.

### What this course is

The intention for this is to stand up as an end-to-end course. To teach the reader the fundementals of good software engineering, to demonstrate how to write effective tests and why this should be the first big thing you learn. And then how this can underpin your daily work.

### What this course is not

Unfortunately the realm of software engineering is enourmous. And I'd be lying to you if I said I could cover all of it. In fact, I'd bet my house that if anyone made that claim then they would also be lying too!
